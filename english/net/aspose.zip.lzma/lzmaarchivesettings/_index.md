## LzmaArchiveSettings class

Settings for LZMA compression method within lzma archive.

```csharp
public class LzmaArchiveSettings
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [LzmaArchiveSettings](lzmaarchivesettings/)() | Initializes a new instance of the `LzmaArchiveSettings` class with default dictionary size, equals to 16 megabytes. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DictionarySize](../../aspose.zip.lzma/lzmaarchivesettings/dictionarysize/) { get; set; } | Dictionary (history buffer) size indicates how many bytes of the recently processed uncompressed data is kept in memory. If not set, will be chosen accordingly to entry size. |

## Remarks

The Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is an algorithm used to perform lossless data compression. This algorithm uses a dictionary compression scheme somewhat similar to the LZ77 algorithm and features a high compression ratio and a variable compression-dictionary size.

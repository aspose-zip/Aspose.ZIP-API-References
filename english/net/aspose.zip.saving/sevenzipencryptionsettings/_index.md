## SevenZipEncryptionSettings class

Base class for settings for several 7z encryption methods.

```csharp
public abstract class SevenZipEncryptionSettings
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EncryptHeader](../../aspose.zip.saving/sevenzipencryptionsettings/encryptheader/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value indicating header encryption. |
| [Password](../../aspose.zip.saving/sevenzipencryptionsettings/password/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets password for encryption or decryption. |

## Remarks

The AES-256 is the only possible encryption method for 7z archive. So the [`SevenZipAESEncryptionSettings`](../sevenzipaesencryptionsettings/) is the only implementation.

## SevenZipLZMA2CompressionSettings.DictionarySize property

Dictionary (history buffer) size indicates how many bytes of the recently processed uncompressed data is kept in memory.

```csharp
public int DictionarySize { get; }
```

### Remarks

The bigger the dictionary, the better the compression ratio usually is, but dictionaries bigger than the uncompressed data are waste of RAM.

## SevenZipLZMA2CompressionSettings constructor (1 of 2)

Instantiates settings for LZMA2 compression method within 7z archive.

```csharp
public SevenZipLZMA2CompressionSettings(int dictionarySize = 16777216)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dictionarySize | Int32 | Size of history buffer, must be between 4096 and 1073741824. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | *dictionarySize* is too big or too small. |

### Remarks

The bigger the dictionary, the better the compression ratio usually is, but dictionaries bigger than the uncompressed data are waste of RAM.

* assembly [Aspose.Zip](../../../)

## SevenZipLZMA2CompressionSettings constructor (2 of 2)

Instantiates settings for LZMA2 compression method within 7z archive.

```csharp
public SevenZipLZMA2CompressionSettings(int dictionarySize, int fastBytes = 32)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dictionarySize | Int32 | Size of history buffer, must be between 4096 and 1073741824. |
| fastBytes | Int32 | Controls number of fast bytes used by the LZMA2 compressors. A larger number of fast bytes can provide a better compression ratio at the expense of compression speed. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | *dictionarySize* is too big or too small, or *fastBytes* is too big or too small. |

### Remarks

The bigger the dictionary, the better the compression ratio usually is, but dictionaries bigger than the uncompressed data are waste of RAM.

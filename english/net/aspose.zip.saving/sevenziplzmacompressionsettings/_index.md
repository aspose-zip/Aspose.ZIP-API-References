## SevenZipLZMACompressionSettings class

Settings for LZMA compression method within 7z archive.

```csharp
public class SevenZipLZMACompressionSettings : SevenZipCompressionSettings
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SevenZipLZMACompressionSettings](sevenziplzmacompressionsettings/)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DictionarySize](../../aspose.zip.saving/sevenziplzmacompressionsettings/dictionarysize/) { get; set; } | Dictionary (history buffer) size indicates how many bytes of the recently processed uncompressed data is kept in memory. If not set, will be chosen accordingly to entry size. |
| override [Method](../../aspose.zip.saving/sevenziplzmacompressionsettings/method/) { get; } | Gets compression or decompression method. |

## Remarks

The Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is an algorithm used to perform lossless data compression. This algorithm uses a dictionary compression scheme somewhat similar to the LZ77 algorithm and features a high compression ratio and a variable compression-dictionary size.

## SevenZipLZMACompressionSettings.NumberOfFastBytes property

Gets the number of bytes used for fast match searching in the LZMA algorithm.

```csharp
public int NumberOfFastBytes { get; }
```

## Remarks

A higher value allows the compressor to search longer matches, which can improve the compression ratio slightly but slows down compression.

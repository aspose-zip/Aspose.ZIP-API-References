## LzmaCompressionSettings.DictionarySize property

Dictionary (history buffer) size indicates how many bytes of the recently processed uncompressed data are kept in memory.

```csharp
public int DictionarySize { get; }
```

## Remarks

The bigger the dictionary, usually the better the compression ratio is - but dictionaries larger than the uncompressed data are a waste of RAM.

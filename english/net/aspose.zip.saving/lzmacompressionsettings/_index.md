## LzmaCompressionSettings class

Settings for LZMA compression method.

```csharp
public class LzmaCompressionSettings : CompressionSettings
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [LzmaCompressionSettings](lzmacompressionsettings)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`LzmaCompressionSettings`](../lzmacompressionsettings) class with default dictionary size, equals to 16 megabytes. |

### Remarks

The Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is an algorithm used to perform lossless data compression. This algorithm uses a dictionary compression scheme somewhat similar to the LZ77 algorithm and features a high compression ratio and a variable compression-dictionary size.

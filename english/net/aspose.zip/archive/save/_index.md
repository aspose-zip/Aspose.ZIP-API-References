## Archive.Save method (2 of 2)

Saves archive to destination file provided.

```csharp
public void Save(string destinationFileName, ArchiveSaveOptions saveOptions = null)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| destinationFileName | String | The path of the archive to be created. If the specified file name points to an existing file, it will be overwritten. |
| saveOptions | ArchiveSaveOptions | Options for archive saving. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | *destinationFileName* is null. |
| SecurityException | The caller does not have the required permission to access. |
| ArgumentException | The *destinationFileName* is empty, contains only white spaces, or contains invalid characters. |
| UnauthorizedAccessException | Access to file *destinationFileName* is denied. |
| PathTooLongException | The specified *destinationFileName*, file name, or both exceed the system-defined maximum length. For example, on Windows-based platforms, paths must be less than 248 characters, and file names must be less than 260 characters. |
| NotSupportedException | File at *destinationFileName* contains a colon (:) in the middle of the string. |

### Remarks

It is possible to save an archive to the same path as it was loaded from. However, this is not recommended because this approach uses copying to temporary file.

### Examples

```csharp
using (var archive = new Archive())
{
    archive.CreateEntry("entry.bin", "data.bin");
    archive.Save("archive.zip",  new ArchiveSaveOptions() { Encoding = Encoding.ASCII });
}
```

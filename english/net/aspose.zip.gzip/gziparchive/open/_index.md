## GzipArchive.Open method

Opens the archive for extraction and provides a stream with archive content.

```csharp
public Stream Open()
```

## Return Value

### Remarks

Read from the stream to get original content of file. See examples section.

### Examples

Extracts the archive and copies extracted content to file stream.

```csharp
using (var archive = new GzipArchive("archive.gz"))
{
    using (var extracted = File.Create("data.bin"))
    {
        var unpacked = archive.Open();
        byte[] b = new byte[8192];
        int bytesRead;
        while (0 < (bytesRead = unpacked.Read(b, 0, b.Length)))
            extracted.Write(b, 0, bytesRead);
    }            
}
```

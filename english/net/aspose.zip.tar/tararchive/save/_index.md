## TarArchive.Save method (2 of 2)

Saves archive to destination file provided.

```csharp
public void Save(string destinationFileName, TarFormat? format = default)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| destinationFileName | String | The path of the archive to be created. If the specified file name points to an existing file, it will be overwritten. |
| format | Nullable`1 | Defines tar header format. Null value will be treated as USTar when possible. |

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentException | *destinationFileName* is a zero-length string, contains only white space, or contains one or more invalid characters as defined by System.IO.Path.InvalidPathChars. |
| ArgumentNullException | *destinationFileName* is null. |
| PathTooLongException | The specified *destinationFileName*, file name, or both exceed the system-defined maximum length. For example, on Windows-based platforms, paths must be less than 248 characters, and file names must be less than 260 characters. |
| DirectoryNotFoundException | The specified *destinationFileName* is invalid, (for example, it is on an unmapped drive). |
| IOException | An I/O error occurred while opening the file. |
| UnauthorizedAccessException | *destinationFileName* specified a file that is read-only and access is not Read.-or- path specified a directory.-or- The caller does not have the required permission. |
| NotSupportedException | *destinationFileName* is in an invalid format. |

### Remarks

It is possible to save an archive to the same path as it was loaded from. However, this is not recommended because this approach uses copying to temporary file.

### Examples

```csharp
using (var archive = new TarArchive())
{
    archive.CreateEntry("entry1", "data.bin");        
    archive.Save("myarchive.tar");
}       
```

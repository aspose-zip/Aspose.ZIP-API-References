## TarArchive.FromLZip method (1 of 2)

Extracts supplied lzip archive and composes [`TarArchive`](../../tararchive) from extracted data.

Important: lzip archive is fully extracted within this method, its content is kept internally. Beware of memory consumption.

```csharp
public static TarArchive FromLZip(Stream source)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| source | Stream | The source of the archive. |

### Return Value

An instance of [`TarArchive`](../../tararchive)

### Remarks

Lzip extraction stream is not seekable by the nature of compression algorithm. Tar archive provides facility to extract arbitrary record, so it has to operate seekable stream under the hood.

* class [TarArchive](../../tararchive)
* namespace [Aspose.Zip.Tar](../../tararchive)
